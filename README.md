## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

1. The vehicle weight, spoiler angle and AWD values are all greated than the 0.05 significance, indicating that these values are not statistically significant. These values are therefore nonrandom.
2. The slope of the line is not zero - when looking at the p-value and the r-squared values, the p-value is significantly smaller, meaning our results are statistically significant. 
3. This model does predict MPG values, but with an about 70% accuracy. The r-squared value in this model is 0.7149, meaning that about 71.49% of these values will actually land on the linear regression line. So somewhat? Not fully accurate. If we could get the r-squared value higher, this regression would be much more useful.
